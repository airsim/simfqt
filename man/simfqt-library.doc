	  C++ Simulated Fare Quote System Library

\section sec_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\code
#include <simfqt/...>
\endcode

\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

SimFQT aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation,
as a C++ library, of a Travel-oriented fare engine. It corresponds to
the simulated version of the real-world Fare Quote or pricing System.

SimFQT makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

The library covers the following areas:
- Calculation of fare from statistics on tickets/coupons
- Fare rules: storage, engine, management
- Retrieval of fares for specific booking requests or product assesment
- Fare rule sets: storage, engine, management
