- Open source release

* 2011-12-05:
- Version 0.1.3
- [Dev] Improved the compilation times for the Boost.Spirit parsers.

  as well as for third-party libraries (e.g., Xapian, SOCI, Boost). The
  rpath/run-path is now inserted into the (library, executable) binaries
  (only when needed, though).
- [Build] Removed any support for the GNU Autotools.

* 2011-08-21:
- Version 0.1.1
- Renamed the binaries (batch and interactive), as to avoid name clashes.
- Took into account the feedback from the review request (bug 732146).

- Version 0.1.0
- First release. SimFQT is able t price all the booking classes of any
  travel solution, thanks to either the interactive binary (fareQuote)
  or the batch (simfqt).
